- **Cinematic - Cool - Kubrick**: Incorporates Nael's lut_Nael.png to create a cool, atmospheric look reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's clinical color palette, particularly in films like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange."

- **Portrait - Soft - Ritts**: Leverages ipsusu's MultiLut_Ipsusu.png for enhanced skin tones with a soft, flattering appearance similar to the ethereal style of photographer Herb Ritts.

- **Light - Noir - Shadow**: A performance-optimized gameplay preset using Nael's lut_Nael.png for a film noir aesthetic with lower vibrance, bluer tones, and enhanced contrast, creating dramatic shadows.

- **Light - Clarity - Crisp**: A lightweight gameplay preset featuring ipsusu's MultiLut_Ipsusu.png that emphasizes clarity and sharpness while maintaining natural colors and good performance.

- **Light - Fantasy - Magical**: Uses Witch's Presets LUT collection to create a fantasy-inspired aesthetic with enhanced color saturation while keeping impact on performance minimal.

- **Light - Vibrant - Colorful**: Employs Okami's MultiLut_Yomi.png for vibrant, colorful gameplay with enhanced saturation and contrast, optimized for performance.
